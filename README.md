# LRTC-HTNN
This file provides the high-order TSVD toolbox and the main code of LRTC-HTNN proposed in Low-Rank High-Order Tensor Completion With Applications in Visual Data, pulished in TIP, 2022

The main contributions of this work including:
1. the framework of high-order tensor SVD framework based on unitary transform is given;
2. the tensor completion for high-order low-rank tensor is formulated and its exact recovery guarantee is proved;
3. several applications to various high-order visual tensor data recovery is studied.
